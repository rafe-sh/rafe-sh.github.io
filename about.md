# About Rafe Sharif

I am a final-year B.Sc. student in **Physics (Minor in Computer Science)** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)**.

My research focuses on **Scientific Computing** and **Machine Learning** applied to complex physical systems. I work at the intersection of data and theory—ranging from probabilistic modeling of **stellar populations** (Gaia DR3) to **computational neuroscience** and **tensor methods** for quantum systems.

## Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn), SQL, LaTeX.
- **Scientific Computing:** Numerical Linear Algebra, Dynamical Systems, MCMC/Probabilistic Modeling.
- **Data Science:** Gaia DR3 Pipelines, Feature Selection, Data Visualization.

## Research Interests
- **Computational Astrophysics:** Probabilistic membership inference, kinematic analysis, and large-scale catalog mining.
- **Machine Learning:** Deep learning (GANs, Autoencoders) and optimization metaheuristics.
- **Quantum Technology:** Tensor methods and numerical linear algebra for simulating many-body systems.

I enjoy collaborating on physics-inspired software projects. Feel free to reach out at **rafe.sharif.moghaddam@gmail.com**.
