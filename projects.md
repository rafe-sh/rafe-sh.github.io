## Computational Astrophysics

### Probabilistic Membership of Open Clusters (MST-GMM)

**Python / Scikit-Learn / Gaia DR3**

- Designed a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) + Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier for large astronomical catalogs
- Demonstrated improved member recovery and reduced contamination compared to standard heuristics
- **Outcome:** Poster presentation at 27th Iranian Astronomy Research Meeting

### Supernova Tracing in Collinder 69

**Data Analysis / Kinematics**

- Building a pipeline to analyze kinematics and chemical-abundance trends in the Lambda Orionis region
- Testing for kinematic signatures of a past supernova event using Gaia DR3 data

## Machine Learning & CS

### Tensor Linear Systems (Einstein Notation)

**Numerical Linear Algebra**

- Analyzed algorithms using Einstein summation notation to solve high-dimensional tensor linear systems: $A_{ijk}X_k = b_{ij}$
- Assessed complexity-accuracy trade-offs for large-scale computations
