I am excited to announce that I will be presenting my work on **Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis of Star Clusters** at the **27th Iranian Astronomy Research Meeting (IASBS)** in May 2025.

The presentation will cover our hybrid **MST-GMM** approach for identifying open star cluster members in Gaia DR3 data.
