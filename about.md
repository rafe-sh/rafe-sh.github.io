# About Me

I am a final-year B.Sc. student in **Physics (Minor in Computer Science)** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)**.

My research focuses on **Scientific Computing** and **Machine Learning** applied to complex physical systems. I work at the intersection of data and theory—ranging from probabilistic modeling of **stellar populations** (Gaia DR3) to **computational neuroscience** and **tensor methods** for quantum systems.
