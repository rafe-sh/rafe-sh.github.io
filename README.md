## About

I am a final-year B.Sc. student in **Physics (Minor in Computer Science)** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)**.

My research focuses on applying **Machine Learning** and **Scientific Computing** to complex physical systems, ranging from probabilistic modeling of stellar populations using Gaia DR3 data to tensor methods for quantum systems.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Astrophysics** — Star cluster membership inference, kinematic analysis, Gaia DR3 data mining
- **Machine Learning** — Deep learning (GANs, Autoencoders), optimization metaheuristics
- **Quantum Technology** — Tensor methods, numerical linear algebra for many-body systems

## Key Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MST-GMM Star Cluster Classifier** | Probabilistic membership inference using Minimum Spanning Trees and Gaussian Mixture Models on Gaia DR3 data |
| **Supernova Tracing in Collinder 69** | Kinematic analysis of Lambda Orionis region to detect historical supernova signatures |
| **Tensor Linear Solvers** | High-dimensional tensor solvers using Einstein summation notation |
