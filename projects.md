Here is a selection of my work bridging Physics, Computer Science, and Data Science.

## 🌌 Computational Astrophysics
### Probabilistic Membership of Open Clusters (MST-GMM)
**Python / Scikit-Learn / Gaia DR3**
*   Designed a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) + Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier for large astronomical catalogs.
*   Demonstrated improved member recovery and reduced contamination compared to standard heuristics.
*   **Outcome:** Poster presentation at 27th Iranian Astronomy Research Meeting.

### Supernova Tracing in Collinder 69
**Data Analysis / Kinematics**
*   Building a pipeline to analyze kinematics and chemical-abundance trends in the Lambda Orionis region.
*   Testing for kinematic signatures of a past supernova event using Gaia DR3 data.

## 🧠 Computational Neuroscience & Bio
### Hopf Bifurcation in Nonlinear Systems
**Python / Numerical Analysis**
*   Modeled and numerically solved a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting a Hopf bifurcation.
*   Implemented numerical continuation and stability analysis to visualize limit cycles and parameter regimes.

### Processing of Visual Stimuli (CORNET-S)
**Neuromatch Academy / Deep Learning**
*   Collaborated on a team analysis of hierarchical representations in the human cortex vs. the CORNET-S deep neural model.
*   Applied Python-based machine learning techniques to study category selectivity.

### NeuroNanostructures & Rehabilitation
**Seminar / Review**
*   Surveyed nanostructure-based approaches to neural interfaces, stroke recovery, and Alzheimer’s treatment.

## 💻 CS & Machine Learning
### Tensor Linear Systems (Einstein Notation)
**Numerical Linear Algebra**
*   Analyzed algorithms using Einstein summation notation to solve high-dimensional tensor linear systems:
    $$ A_{ijk}X_k = b_{ij} $$
*   Assessed complexity-accuracy trade-offs for large-scale computations.

### Deep Learning Suite (MNIST)
**PyTorch / GANs / Autoencoders**
*   Implemented a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** for digit synthesis.
*   Built an **Autoencoder** for dimensionality reduction and image reconstruction.

### Hybrid PSO with Local Search
**Optimization / Metaheuristics**
*   Developed a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with local refinement.
*   Benchmarked convergence speed and solution quality against standard datasets.
