> **Status:** Active Development | **Focus:** Computational Astrophysics, Tensor Methods, Machine Learning

## 1. Abstract & Executive Summary

[Placeholder: Insert a concise, 1-2 paragraph Executive Summary defining the problem space and the high-level impact of the solution. Example: "This digital portfolio aggregates research on **MST-GMM probabilistic workflows** and **tensor methods** for astrophysical data analysis. It serves as a central hub for disseminating findings related to open star cluster membership inference using **Gaia DR3 data**, bridging the gap between theoretical physics and computational science."]

## 2. Core Research Question & Thesis

[Placeholder: Define the central hypothesis of your work. Example: "How can high-dimensional tensor decomposition improve the accuracy of membership inference in dense stellar fields compared to traditional probabilistic models? This platform explores the application of **data-driven astrophysics** to solve such complexity."]

## 3. Technical & Research Stack

### Academic Research Stack
*   **Languages:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), MATLAB.
*   **Core Methods:** Tensor Decompositions, Probabilistic Modeling (GMM), Graph Theory (MST).
*   **Data Sources:** Gaia DR3, SIMBAD.
*   **Tools:** Jupyter, LaTeX, Git.

### Portfolio Web Architecture
*   **Framework:** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Static Site Generator).
*   **Styling:** SASS/SCSS, Responsive Design.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Netlify (CI/CD pipelines).
*   **Templating:** Liquid.

## 4. Key Findings & Results

[Placeholder: Summarize 3-5 pivotal outcomes. Example:
*   "Developed a novel MST-GMM hybrid algorithm increasing membership probability accuracy by 15%."
*   "identified X new candidate stars in the Y cluster using tensor-based feature extraction."
*   "Published findings on numerical stability in large-scale matrix computations."]

## 5. Methodology

[Placeholder: Describe the research workflow. Example: "Data is ingested from the Gaia DR3 archive, pre-processed for kinematic parameters (proper motion, parallax), and modeled using a Gaussian Mixture Model refined by Minimum Spanning Tree clustering to isolate gravitationally bound members."]

## 6. Future Work

[Placeholder: Outline next steps. Example: "Integrating Deep Learning autoencoders for unsupervised feature discovery in stellar spectra. Expanding the portfolio to include interactive data visualizations using D3.js."]

## 8. Implementation Guide for Jules

**Objective:** Transition this repository into a production-ready academic portfolio.

- [ ] **Branding & Design Verification**
    - [ ] Update `_config.yml` with final color palettes matching academic institution branding (if applicable).
    - [ ] Verify favicon and Open Graph images (`author_logo`) are high-resolution.
    - [ ] Ensure typography is readable and professional (e.g., Serif for body, Sans-Serif for headers).

- [ ] **Content Injection**
    - [ ] Replace all "[Placeholder]" text in `README.md` and site pages (`about.md`, `projects.md`) with actual research data.
    - [ ] Populate `_data/publications.yml` (if it exists) or create it to structure the publication list.

- [ ] **Technical Optimization**
    - [ ] Run `jekyll build` to ensure no Liquid syntax errors.
    - [ ] Audit `_includes/head.html` for proper SEO meta tags (Description, Keywords, Author).
    - [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness on `projects` and `publications` layouts.
    - [ ] Check accessibility (contrast ratios, alt text for charts/images).

- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline**
    - [ ] Confirm GitHub Actions/Netlify build settings match the `Gemfile` dependencies.
    - [ ] Test the contact form endpoint (Formspree/Getform) configured in `_config.yml`.
